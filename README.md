## ★ ! INFO
#### ꒰ ' **BASIC** . ꒱
copying **will** result in a hide. ask b4 using inspo whisper 2 int, kisses, boops, and crowns are welcomed!! if i hide you its either due to my [DNI list](https://sntry.cc/killrqueen) or you made me uncomfortable lol ; i have trouble socializing with others so please keep in mind. often afk or with friends when in public servers. ask before sitting with me plz........ im antisocial at times
#### ꒰ ' **EXTRA** . ꒱
just because i sit with friends or kiss them does **not** mean i ship the characters..??? just bc i made a "problematic" character as a skin doesn't mean i idolize them. i change tones often sorry im going thru character development arc :/ i use stuff like ">_<" as a joke sometimes and you will NEVERcatch me being serious!!!
